# NEO Supply Chain Management

This project showcases a straightforward implementation of a coffee bean supply chain management system on the NEO blockchain. It addresses the needs of various stakeholders involved in the supply chain by defining specific roles, including:

* Farmer
* Distributor
* Retailer
* Consumer
* Customer

The aim of this use case is to provide transparency for stakeholders by allowing them to track the journey of an individual item within the supply chain. Each item is associated with a unique identifier, stock keeping unit, and relevant farm and farmer information, among other attributes. By leveraging the NEO blockchain, stakeholders can monitor the item's progress through the supply chain, enhancing trust and visibility among all parties involved.
